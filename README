This is a module allowing for nice, structured argument passing in Perl 5. If you like name-based argument passing, but want a bit more sophistication as to how it works, this should help you make your larger coding projects more structured.

Use perldoc on the module for detailed instructions on how it works. If you're on Unix, "perldoc Argpass.pm" should do what you want.
